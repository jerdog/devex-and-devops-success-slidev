# Developer Experience...

## Central to DevOps Success

<!-- A quick note that most of the images have been autogenerated by AI - which would explain some of the weird shapes and colors in the images. -->

# What is "Developer Experience" (DevEx)?

<!--
We've all had that experience using a tool or service that was a disaster. It could be the worst deployment process you've ever seen, or the most painful codebase you've ever had to work with, or documentation that's so confusing it makes your head spin. Or maybe a combination of them… Who here knows what I’m talking about? 

We’ve all seen examples of epicly bad websites, right?

```bash
git push heroku main
```

![Heroku deploy button](/images/slides/heroku-deploy-button.png)

<!--
Heroku was long considered the gold standard for developer experience with a simple set of tools and a command-line interface that allowed developers to focus on building applications and delivering them to users. And that was it. Now of course, Heroku is still around (albeit not nearly as developer-centric as they formerly were, but that is changing), but it's not the only game in town. Anyone used Netlify, Vercel, etc.?

## A working definition of DevEx
  
>_"...the **journey** of developers and practitioners as they learn and deploy technology, which if successful, focuses on eliminating obstacles that hinder them from achieving success in their endeavors."_

-**Jessica West**, _Co-Founder, DevEx Institute_

<!--
Let's start with a definition of DevEx - DevEx is the journey of developers as they learn and deploy technology. When successful, it focuses on eliminating obstacles that hinder a developer or practitioner from achieving success in their endeavors.

## DevEx isn't new

_REF: F. Fagerholm and J. Münch, "[Developer experience: Concept and definition](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6225984?arnumber=6225984)," 2012 International Conference on Software and System Process (ICSSP), Zurich, Switzerland, 2012._

<!--
But DevEx isn't a new thing. The first mention of "developer experience" as a concept was in a paper was presented at the June IEEE 2012 International Conference on Software and System Process in Zurich. There are references in the paper going back to 1985 that deal with "programmer performance and the effects of the workplace." A few things stand out in this paper, which is a really great read.

## DevEx isn't new

>"New ways of working such as globally distributed development or the integration of self-motivated external developers into software ecosystems will require a better and more comprehensive understanding of developers' feelings, perceptions, motivations and identification with their tasks in their respective project environments."

_REF: F. Fagerholm and J. Münch, "[Developer experience: Concept and definition](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6225984?arnumber=6225984). 2012."_

## DevEx isn't new

>"...developer experience could be defined as a means for capturing how developers think and feel about their activities within their working environments, with the assumption that an improvement of the developer experience has positive impacts on characteristics such as sustained team and project performance."

_REF: F. Fagerholm and J. Münch, "[Developer experience: Concept and definition](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6225984?arnumber=6225984). 2012."_

<!--
The second was this line, that DevEx could be a means for capturing how devs think and feel about their activities at work, and that improving their experience impacts things like sustained team and project performance.

So all of this interest in DevEx isn't a new concept - but is largely driven by companies trying to sell you something, from the top down, with very little (if any) focus on developers themselves. We've all been there - we've been told we need to adopt a new way of working, and then had some new tool from some friend on the C-Suite who says that by simply using it, we'll be happier, more productive, and instantly a 10x engineer. Meanwhile, you've used it before and it's shit.

### Point of clarification

<v-clicks>

- "DevEx" by default focuses on "developer"
- View "DevEx" as a whole of the lifecycle

</v-clicks>

<!--
I think it's important to clarify that "DevEx" by default focuses on the "developer", but we should really view DevEx as a whole part of the lifecycle, and not just for developers only.
-->

---


<!--
It's their overall satisfaction and efficiency while working on software projects. It's the tools, the processes, and the environments that shape their interactions with code, infrastructure, and each other. A positive DevEx is crucial for enhancing productivity as it directly influences how quickly and effectively developers can build, test, and deploy software.
-->

---
layout: image
image: "/images/slides/devex-integral-dev-lifecycle.jpg"
---

<!--
DevEx is such an integral part of the entire development lifecycle - not just if you're developing tools for use internally, choosing off-the-shelf tools to use, or creating products for other developers and companies to use. That means that the ease of use, reliability, how accessible and understandable documentation, how efficient the build processes are, the effectiveness of testing frameworks, and the smoothness of deployment procedures all have an impact on the overall dev experience.

And we've see an evolution in Developer Experience over the years.

# Evolution of the IDE

## Early text editors

![USER FRIENDLY by Illiad, vi](/images/slides/httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages2055076.png)
REF: O'Reilly "Learning the vi and Vim Editors"

<!--
I think a great example is the evolution of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs). Prior to the 1990's, you had mostly text-based editors that were used to write code, like Vi, which evidently is supposed to be called "SIX". Who knew? It was created in 1976 and included in the first BSD linux release.

<!-- Then we had Emacs in 1985, Vim in 1991, my personal favorite, `nano`. And not entirely because I can exit it without having to throw out the computer and buy a new one like I do with Vim. Saving the planet, one less computer thrown away because of Vim at a time. -->

- 1995: Microsoft FrontPage

</v-clicks>

<!--
With the launch of the World Wide Web, and then its explosion of growth, the IDEs started becoming more graphical and had a more modern look and feel. Who remembers the first HTML WYSIWYG editor? SGI's WebMagic was released on January 25, 1995 built in less than 90 days. FrontPage (https://softpanorama.org/Office/Frontpage/history.shtml) was soon to follow in October 1995 after Microsoft acquired it from Vermeer.

## Features & Usability

### Late 1990s to 2000s

<v-clicks>

- 1997: Macromedia Dreamweaver
- 1997: Netscape Composer
- 1997: Microsoft Visual Studio
- 1999: Microsoft FrontPage 2000
- 2000: NetBeans
- 2001: IntelliJ IDEA
- 2001: Eclipse IDE
- 2002: Microsoft Visual Studio .NET

</v-clicks>

<!--
Macromedia's Dreamweaver came out in 1997 (after Macromedia acquisition of Backstage from iBand in 1996) Dreamweaver completely changed the game in many respects, as Macromedia had a history of their products getting community-sourced tools, plugins, scripts, etc. Microsoft FrontPage 2000 saw the first inclusion of plugins and integrations in early 1999 to make web management easier (FrontPage Server Extensions). NetBeans was released in 2000 for Java, with IntelliJ and Eclipse following in 2001 along with Visual Studio which offered enhanced functionality and more sophisticated features like intelligent code completion, refactoring tools, and improved version control integration. We saw a noticeable increase in support for multiple languages and frameworks, making these IDEs more versatile. Microsoft Visual Studio .NET was released in 2002, offering a more modern and feature-rich IDE for .NET development.

<!--
Late 2000s brought about more lightweight IDEs, like Sublime Text and later Atom and Visual Studio Code (VSCode) emerged, focusing on speed, user-friendly interfaces, and extensive plugin ecosystems. They catered to a broader range of developers by being less resource-intensive and more customizable. Event saw integrations with popular Ops tools as well.

<!--
Then, we have seen the rise of the cloud and the arrival of cloud-based IDEs: The first was PHPanywhere (eventually becoming CodeAnywhere) in 2009, followed by Cloud9 in 2010 (before AWS bought it in 2016), Glitch (2018), GitPod (2019), GitHub Codespaces (2020), and Google’s Project IDX (2024). They've really changed the game by offering fully configured development environments in the cloud, accessible from anywhere, reducing the need for complex local setup.
