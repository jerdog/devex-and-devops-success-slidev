  ## Developer Experience is Central to DevOps Success

  ## Abstract
  Developer Experience (DevEx) encompasses every aspect of the experience that your developers (both internal and external) have with your product, tooling, systems, etc. While platform engineering aims to reduce developer toil, DevEx goes beyond that. It covers deployment pipelines, Infrastructure as Code (IaC) practices, developer efficiencies, productivity, UI/UX, and APIs. In this presentation, we will focus on some of the principles of DevOps (collaboration, communication, shared responsibility), go into the history of DevEx and how it's changed over the years (remember Vim? CFEngine?), and how a strong DevEx mindset can bring together development and operations teams.

# Developer Experience...

## Central to DevOps Success

<!-- A quick note that most of the images have been autogenerated by AI - which would explain some of the weird shapes and colors in the images. -->

# What is "Developer Experience" (DevEx)?

<!--
We've all had that experience using a tool or service that was a disaster. It could be the worst deployment process you've ever seen, or the most painful codebase you've ever had to work with, or documentation that's so confusing it makes your head spin. Or maybe a combination of them… Who here knows what I’m talking about? 

We’ve all seen examples of epicly bad websites, right?

```bash
git push heroku main
```

![Heroku deploy button](/images/slides/heroku-deploy-button.png)

<!--
Heroku was long considered the gold standard for developer experience with a simple set of tools and a command-line interface that allowed developers to focus on building applications and delivering them to users. And that was it. Now of course, Heroku is still around (albeit not nearly as developer-centric as they formerly were, but that is changing), but it's not the only game in town. Anyone used Netlify, Vercel, etc.?

## A working definition of DevEx
  
>_"...the **journey** of developers and practitioners as they learn and deploy technology, which if successful, focuses on eliminating obstacles that hinder them from achieving success in their endeavors."_

-**Jessica West**, _Co-Founder, DevEx Institute_

<!--
Let's start with a definition of DevEx - DevEx is the journey of developers as they learn and deploy technology. When successful, it focuses on eliminating obstacles that hinder a developer or practitioner from achieving success in their endeavors.

## DevEx isn't new

_REF: F. Fagerholm and J. Münch, "[Developer experience: Concept and definition](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6225984?arnumber=6225984)," 2012 International Conference on Software and System Process (ICSSP), Zurich, Switzerland, 2012._

<!--
But DevEx isn't a new thing. The first mention of "developer experience" as a concept was in a paper was presented at the June IEEE 2012 International Conference on Software and System Process in Zurich. There are references in the paper going back to 1985 that deal with "programmer performance and the effects of the workplace." A few things stand out in this paper, which is a really great read.

## DevEx isn't new

>"New ways of working such as globally distributed development or the integration of self-motivated external developers into software ecosystems will require a better and more comprehensive understanding of developers' feelings, perceptions, motivations and identification with their tasks in their respective project environments."

## DevEx isn't new

>"...developer experience could be defined as a means for capturing how developers think and feel about their activities within their working environments, with the assumption that an improvement of the developer experience has positive impacts on characteristics such as sustained team and project performance."

_REF: F. Fagerholm and J. Münch, "[Developer experience: Concept and definition](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6225984?arnumber=6225984). 2012."_

<!--
The second was this line, that DevEx could be a means for capturing how devs think and feel about their activities at work, and that improving their experience impacts things like sustained team and project performance.

So all of this interest in DevEx isn't a new concept - but is largely driven by companies trying to sell you something, from the top down, with very little (if any) focus on developers themselves. We've all been there - we've been told we need to adopt a new way of working, and then had some new tool from some friend on the C-Suite who says that by simply using it, we'll be happier, more productive, and instantly a 10x engineer. Meanwhile, you've used it before and it's shit.

### Point of clarification

<v-clicks>

- "DevEx" by default focuses on "developer"
- View "DevEx" as a whole of the lifecycle

</v-clicks>

<!--
I think it's important to clarify that "DevEx" by default focuses on the "developer", but we should really view DevEx as a whole part of the lifecycle, and not just for developers only.
-->

---
layout: image
image: "/images/slides/good-devex-overall-satisfaction.jpg"
---


<!--
It's their overall satisfaction and efficiency while working on software projects. It's the tools, the processes, and the environments that shape their interactions with code, infrastructure, and each other. A positive DevEx is crucial for enhancing productivity as it directly influences how quickly and effectively developers can build, test, and deploy software.
-->

---
layout: image
image: "/images/slides/devex-integral-dev-lifecycle.jpg"
---

<!--
DevEx is such an integral part of the entire development lifecycle - not just if you're developing tools for use internally, choosing off-the-shelf tools to use, or creating products for other developers and companies to use. That means that the ease of use, reliability, how accessible and understandable documentation, how efficient the build processes are, the effectiveness of testing frameworks, and the smoothness of deployment procedures all have an impact on the overall dev experience.
-->

<!--
I think a great example is the evolution of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs). Prior to the 1990's, you had mostly text-based editors that were used to write code, like Vi, which evidently is supposed to be called "SIX". Who knew? It was created in 1976 and included in the first BSD linux release.

<!--
Macromedia's Dreamweaver came out in 1997 (after Macromedia acquisition of Backstage from iBand in 1996) Dreamweaver completely changed the game in many respects, as Macromedia had a history of their products getting community-sourced tools, plugins, scripts, etc. Microsoft FrontPage 2000 saw the first inclusion of plugins and integrations in early 1999 to make web management easier (FrontPage Server Extensions). NetBeans was released in 2000 for Java, with IntelliJ and Eclipse following in 2001 along with Visual Studio which offered enhanced functionality and more sophisticated features like intelligent code completion, refactoring tools, and improved version control integration. We saw a noticeable increase in support for multiple languages and frameworks, making these IDEs more versatile. Microsoft Visual Studio .NET was released in 2002, offering a more modern and feature-rich IDE for .NET development.

## DevOps Principles + DevEx alignment

- Enhanced collaboration **_via tools and processes_**

- Improving communication **_via streamlined info sharing and feedback_**

<!-- 
When we are **improving Communication** , we start to utilize platforms and tools that streamline information sharing and feedback across teams. That includes your CI/CD pipelines, shared dashboards, and automated alerting systems ensure all team members have visibility into the development process, can easily share updates, and quickly address issues.

## DevOps Principles + DevEx alignment

- Collaboration

- Communication

- Shared Responsibility

<!-- 
**Shared Responsibility** in DevOps means there is **collective accountability for the software's quality and reliability, blurring the lines between roles traditionally separated by development and operations.** It's about **moving away from a "not my job" mentality to a "we're in this together" mindset, where success and failures are shared equally**.
-->

## DevOps Principles + DevEx alignment

- Enhanced collaboration **_via tools and processes_**

- Improving communication **_via streamlined info sharing and feedback_**

- Shared responsibility **_by empowering all teams with access and information_**

<!-- 
That **Shared Responsibility** brings empowerment to all team members with access to the tools and information they need to contribute across the entire software lifecycle. **By democratizing access to tools and information, DevEx encourages a culture where everyone feels ownership of the product and is motivated to contribute to its success.**

<!-- 
Organizations seeking to build more cohesive, agile, and effective teams who are better equipped to meet the demands of modern software development, have to ensure that they don't stop at just these core DevOps principles - but that they ensure an emphasis on DevEx in the implementation of the tooling. If it's a poor experience, you aren't going to see the results you want.

I think a good example is what we've seen with Platform Engineering the last few years.

### Bringing DevOps and DevEx Together
When organizations prioritize DevEx, they ensure that devs have access to tools and processes that not only streamline their workflow but also facilitate a smoother transition of code from development to production. This alignment encourages both teams to work closely from the outset of projects, sharing insights, feedback, and responsibilities, which enhances the efficiency of the development lifecycle and leads to higher quality outcomes. Which strenghtens the implementation of DevOps culture and practices.

<!-- 
Some of the better practices to keep in mind when leveling up with DevEx are:
**Equip teams** with integrated, user-friendly tools that support automation, collaboration, and real-time communication. Choose the tools which align with both Dev and Ops needs. Get their input in the decision. Just because your buddy's IT startup says they offer 10x developer productivity doesn't mean it works for your teams, much less that it works at all.
**Put in place cross-functional teams** that include roles with diverse expertise (e.g., development, operations, quality assurance) to foster a shared understanding and responsibility from project inception through to deployment and maintenance.  
**Establishing robust feedback mechanisms** allow for continuous learning and improvement. Conduct regular retrospectives, incorporate user feedback into development cycles, and use monitoring tools to gather insights on performance and user experience.  
Reduce toil and free up team members to focus on more strategic activities by **automating repetitive and manual tasks wherever possible.** This includes automating testing, deployments, and infrastructure provisioning.  
**Ensure that team members have opportunities to learn and grow** their skills in both development and operations domains. This helps in building empathy between teams and equips individuals with the knowledge to understand and contribute to different stages of the development lifecycle.

<!--
Standardize development environment setup: Use configuration management tools and streamline onboarding processes to ensure a consistent and efficient development environment for all team members.
Some examples: JFrog’s Artifactory provides that centralized repo for all artifact types, making it easy for deves to find the resources they need; JFrog’s Pipelines provides a CI/CD platform for automating the build, test, deployment process. There’s also JFrog’s new collaboration with GitHub announced today. Atlassian provides a suite of tools which integration collaboration, communication, and knowledge sharing. GitHub and Gitlab provide version control and collaboration. Ansible helps to quickly and consistently set up development environments, saving time and reducing the risk of configuration errors.
