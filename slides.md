# Developer Experience...

## Central to DevOps Success

<!-- A quick note that most of the images have been autogenerated by AI - which would explain some of the weird shapes and colors in the images. -->

---

## What is Developer Experience?

![good and bad devex](/images/slides/2-good-and-bad-devex.jpeg)

<!-- From the simplicity of the setup process to the complexity of solving production issues, DevEx directly impacts developer productivity, satisfaction, and ultimately, the quality of the products they build and use. -->

---

### DevEx is _more_ than just your parent's DevOps lifecycle

<!--
DevEx is an integral part of the entire DevOps lifecycle, as a direct result of the choice of development tools, technologies, and platforms. That means that the ease of use, reliability, how accessible and understandable documentation, how efficient the build processes are, the effectiveness of testing frameworks, and the smoothness of deployment procedures all have an impact on the overall dev experience.

## DevEx isn't new

REF: F. Fagerholm and J. Münch, "[Developer experience: Concept and definition](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6225984?arnumber=6225984)," 2012 International Conference on Software and System Process (ICSSP), Zurich, Switzerland, 2012.

<!--
But DevEx isn't a new thing. The first mention of "developer experience" as a concept was in a paper was presented at the June IEEE 2012 International Conference on Software and System Process in Zurich. There are references in the paper going back to 1985 that deal with "programmer performance and the effects of the workplace." A few things stand out in this paper, which is a really great read.

>"New ways of working such as globally distributed development or the integration of self-motivated external developers into software ecosystems will require a better and more comprehensive understanding of developers' feelings, perceptions, motivations and identification with their tasks in their respective project environments."

>"...developer experience could be defined as a means for capturing how developers think and feel about their activities within their working environments, with the assumption that an improvement of the developer experience has positive impacts on characteristics such as sustained team and project performance."

<!--
The second was this line, that DevEx could be a means for capturing how devs think and feel about their activities at work, and that improving their experience impacts things like sustained team and project performance.

So all of this interest in DevEx isn't a new concept - but is largely driven by companies trying to sell you something, from the top down, with very little (if any) focus on developers themselves. We've all been there - we've been told we need to adopt a new way of working, and then had some new tool from some friend on the C-Suite who says that by simply using it, we'll be happier, more productive, and instantly a 10x engineer. Meanwhile, you've used it before and it's shit.

### Point of clarification

<v-clicks>

- "DevEx" by default focuses on "developer"
- View "DevEx" as a whole of the lifecycle

</v-clicks>

<!--
I think it's important to clarify that "DevEx" by default focuses on the "developer", but we should really view DevEx as a whole part of the lifecycle, and not just for developers only.
-->

### Workshop some new terms

- "DevOps Experience"
- "DevExOps"
- "DevOpsEx"
- ?????

<!-- So I figured today would be a good day to workshop some new terms. Maybe as "DevOps Experience" or "DevExOps" or "DevOpsEx"? -->

# A working definition of DevEx
  
>_"...the **journey** of developers as they learn and deploy technology, which if successful, focuses on eliminating obstacles that hinder a developer or practitioner from achieving success in their endeavors."  
> -Jessica West, Co-Founder, DevEx Institute_

<!--
Let's start with a definition of DevEx - DevEx is the journey of developers as they learn and deploy technology. When successful, it focuses on eliminating obstacles that hinder a developer or practitioner from achieving success in their endeavors.

## DevEx includes every interaction a developer/ops practitioner has with systems, tools, and processes

it is about every interaction a developer or ops practitioner has with systems, tools, and processes. And we've see an evolution in Developer Experience over the years.

Here's an example of how Developer Experience has evolved a particular set of tools and practices:

## The evolution of the IDE
### Early text editors

![USER FRIENDLY by Illiad, vi](/images/slides/httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages2055076.png)
REF: O'Reilly "Learning the vi and Vim Editors"

<!-- 
I think a great example is the evolution of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs). Prior to the 1990's, you had mostly text-based editors that were used to write code, like Vi, which evidently is supposed to be called "SIX". Who knew? It was created in 1976 and included in the first BSD linux release.

## The evolution of the IDE

### Early text editors

- Vi (1976)
- Emacs (1985)
- Vim (1991)
- Nano (1999)

<!--
Then we had Emacs in 1985, Vim in 1991, my personal favorite, `nano`. And not entirely because I can exit it without having to throw out the computer and buy a new one like I do with Vim. Saving the planet, one less computer thrown away because of Vim at a time.

### Early reviews...

<!-- The early reviews of IDEs as a concept weren't great.... In 1995 Computer Week in Germany commented that the use of an IDE was not well received by developers since it would fence in their creativity. -->
