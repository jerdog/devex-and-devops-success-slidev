## What is Developer Experience?

![good and bad devex](/images/slides/2-good-and-bad-devex.jpeg)

{{% note %}}
From the simplicity of the setup process to the complexity of solving production issues, DevEx directly impacts developer productivity, satisfaction, and ultimately, the quality of the products they build and use.

### DevEx is _more_ than just your parent's DevOps lifecycle

{{% note %}}
DevEx is an integral part of the entire DevOps lifecycle, as a direct result of the choice of development tools, technologies, and platforms. That means that the ease of use, reliability, how accessible and understandable documentation, how efficient the build processes are, the effectiveness of testing frameworks, and the smoothness of deployment procedures all have an impact on the overall dev experience.

{{% note %}}
But DevEx isn't a new thing. The first mention of "developer experience" as a concept was in a paper was presented at the June IEEE 2012 International Conference on Software and System Process in Zurich. There are references in the paper going back to 1985 that deal with "programmer performance and the effects of the workplace." A few things stand out in this paper, which is a really great read.

REF: F. Fagerholm and J. Münch, "[Developer experience: Concept and definition](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6225984?arnumber=6225984)," 2012 International Conference on Software and System Process (ICSSP), Zurich, Switzerland, 2012.

{{% note %}}
The second was this line, that DevEx could be a means for capturing how devs think and feel about their activities at work, and that improving their experience impacts things like sustained team and project performance.

So all of this interest in DevEx isn't a new concept - but is largely driven by companies trying to sell you something, from the top down, with very little (if any) focus on developers themselves. We've all been there - we've been told we need to adopt a new way of working, and then had some new tool from some friend on the C-Suite who says that by simply using it, we'll be happier, more productive, and instantly a 10x engineer. Meanwhile, you've used it before and it's shit.

### Point of clarification

- "DevEx" by default focuses on "developer"
- View "DevEx" as a whole of the lifecycle
 
{{% note %}}
After chatting with Sasha the other day, I think it's important to clarify that "DevEx" by default focuses on the "developer", but we should really view DevEx as a whole part of the lifecycle, and not just for developers only.

{{% note %}}
I think a great example is the evolution of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs). Prior to the 1990's, you had mostly text-based editors that were used to write code, like Vi, which evidently is supposed to be called "SIX". Who knew? It was created in 1976 and included in the first BSD linux release.

{{% note %}}
Macromedia's Dreamweaver came out in 1997 (after Macromedia acquisition of Backstage from iBand in 1996) Dreamweaver completely changed the game in many respects, as Macromedia had a history of their products getting community-sourced tools, plugins, scripts, etc. Microsoft FrontPage 2000 saw the first inclusion of plugins and integrations in early 1999 to make web management easier (FrontPage Server Extensions). NetBeans was released in 2000 for Java, with IntelliJ and Eclipse following in 2001 along with Visual Studio which offered enhanced functionality and more sophisticated features like intelligent code completion, refactoring tools, and improved version control integration. We saw a noticeable increase in support for multiple languages and frameworks, making these IDEs more versatile.

Then, we have seen the rise of the cloud and the arrival of cloud-based IDEs: The first was PHPanywhere (eventually becoming CodeAnywhere) in 2009, followed by Cloud9 in 2010 (before AWS bought it in 2016), Glitch (2018), GitPod (2019), GitHub Codespaces (2020), and Google’s Project IDX (2024). They've really changed the game by offering fully configured development environments in the cloud, accessible from anywhere, reducing the need for complex local setup.

{{% note %}}
Another quick example is the setup of environments like dev, staging, and production. In the early days, setting up an environment involved manually configuring each tool, library, and dependency, which was time-consuming and error-prone. Practitioners often struggled with version conflicts and compatibility issues between different tools and libraries. In the mid- to late-90s systems like CFEngine v1 and CFEngine v2 emerged to automate this process.

Organizations seeking to build more cohesive, agile, and effective teams who are better equipped to meet the demands of modern software development, have to ensure that they don't stop at just these core DevOps principles - but that they ensure an emphasis on DevEx in the implementation of the tooling. If it's a poor experience, you aren't going to see the results you want.

I think a good example is what we've seen with Platform Engineering the last few years.

### The rise of Platform Engineering

- Creation of specific, integrated environments that devs need
- Abstract away complexities of infrastructure & backend services
- Ensure devs have access to robust, scalable, easy-to-use platforms
- Streamline development processes and reduce setup time

{{% note %}}
The rise of platform engineering represents a paradigm shift **towards creating comprehensive, integrated environments that cater specifically to the needs of developers**. Focusing on **abstracting away the complexities of infrastructure and backend services**, allows developers to concentrate on writing code and creating value. Platform engineering embodies the principles of DevEx by **ensuring that developers have access to robust, scalable, and easy-to-use platforms**. which **streamline development processes, reduce setup time**, and allow for a focus on innovation rather than maintenance, removing a lot of developer toil.

### Bringing DevOps and DevEx Together
When organizations prioritize DevEx, they ensure that devs have access to tools and processes that not only streamline their workflow but also facilitate a smoother transition of code from development to production. This alignment encourages both teams to work closely from the outset of projects, sharing insights, feedback, and responsibilities, which enhances the efficiency of the development lifecycle and leads to higher quality outcomes. Which strenghtens the implementation of DevOps culture and practices.

### Better Practices for leveling up your "DevOps Experience"

- Empower with the right tools
- Encourage Cross-functional Teams
- Implement Feedback Loops
- Focus on Automation
- Invest in Training and Development

{{% note %}}
Some of the better practices to keep in mind when leveling up with DevEx are:
**Equip teams** with integrated, user-friendly tools that support automation, collaboration, and real-time communication. Choose the tools which align with both Dev and Ops needs. Get their input in the decision. Just because your buddy's IT startup says they offer 10x developer productivity doesn't mean it works for your teams, much less that it works at all.
**Put in place cross-functional teams** that include roles with diverse expertise (e.g., development, operations, quality assurance) to foster a shared understanding and responsibility from project inception through to deployment and maintenance.  
**Establishing robust feedback mechanisms** allow for continuous learning and improvement. Conduct regular retrospectives, incorporate user feedback into development cycles, and use monitoring tools to gather insights on performance and user experience.  
Reduce toil and free up team members to focus on more strategic activities by **automating repetitive and manual tasks wherever possible.** This includes automating testing, deployments, and infrastructure provisioning.  
**Ensure that team members have opportunities to learn and grow** their skills in both development and operations domains. This helps in building empathy between teams and equips individuals with the knowledge to understand and contribute to different stages of the development lifecycle.

### DevEx reflects an organizations values

{{% tweet user="IAmJerdog" id="1750563607266410692" %}}

{{% note %}}
The level of investment that a company invests in DevEx can be a reflection of a company's values towards its employees, especially its developers. A strong focus on DevEx shows a commitment to employee well-being and efficiency. And prioritizing DevEx helps foster a culture of excellence and innovation. When developers are provided with the right tools, support, and environment, they are more likely to produce high-quality work and push the boundaries of what's possible.
